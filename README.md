TMA is the first distributed ledger that implements full sharding. Currently it consists of 8 blockchain that are collectively merge mined but it will start splitting into more shards as more nodes join  the network. Please check message board at https://cointma.org for more information.

Installation instructions

First install latest Java, later than 1.8.0_172. Older version might have some problem with cryptography strength. Java 64 bit works faster. Go to https://github.com/tmacoin/tma and select download zip. Unzip it into folder where you have full access. Double click on either tma.bat or tmagui.bat and enter passphrase that you will not forget. tmagui.bat only works on Windows. Check tma.log file in log directory. tma.sh works on Linux without GUI. Tested nongui on Macintosh, Ubuntu and Solaris. To speedup initial start up, instead of downloading a blockchain using application it is faster to download one of 8 blockchains from this link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fhvBgXA7mG2w9a9KIadAo9Mg2GJFuQN3 It is better to select a random blockchain to distribute nodes evenly between shards

In order to start mining minimum balance of one coin is required.
